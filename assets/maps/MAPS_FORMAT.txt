Maps are quite easy to make. It's a simple text file, translated to a double array of characters by the program.
For the dimensions, you can choose the size you want but the max has to be the size of a screen you choose in the main.py, because if you dont and the terminal is not big enough it will crash.
Dont forget to put a border tho it will disapear behind the screen border if you made the map as big as possible (it's pretty I promise).
Here is an example of a simple map that was made:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%                                  │   │                              %
%──────────────────┐               │   │                  ┌─────┐     %
%            /\    └────────────┐  │   │    ┌─────────────┘     │     %
%           /  \                └──┤   ├────┘     ▲             └─────%
%          /────\                  │   │         /─\                  %

%      │ │                 *         *      │~       │D               %
%      ├D┤                   *******        └│┌─────┐│┘┐              %
%                                                                     %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Each map file is stored in assets/maps/ and is named with the map id (snake_case) followed by .txt
For example the map above is stored in assets/maps/village2.txt

You may have noticed multiple things. You have a lot of different characters, even unicode ones, and you have a lot of '£'.
The map is not rectangular either.
This is because of the unicode characters, they take 2 characters in the terminal but are registered as one character in the text file and the array.
It leads to collisions problems, this is why we use '£' after unicode characters as the ui turns them into '' but the collision is still there. I did not find a better way for now so please if you want to use unicode, you can absolutelu but you HAVE TO had a '£' after each unicode character.
Don't worry about the fact that the map is currently not rectangular, as the '£' are not visible, it looks rectangular in the end.

By default, the walkable characters are:
['.', ',', ';', ':', '*', ' '] so in our exemple, all the areas with '*' are walkable.
For now, if you want to change the walkable characters, you have to do a self.walkable_tiles = [...] when you create your map function/class (Sorry for that I did not make a method to change that yet).

Informations to add a map to the game are in extensions/data_extensions.py but here is a quick summary:
you can either use a class or a function to create your map. I suggess using a function most of the time as it's easier but you have the choice. Use a class if you need special values or methods for your map.
Either way, your map depend on the World class from engine/core/base.py so you have to import it.
if you use a function, you have to return a World object.
Here is an example of a map function:

from engine.core.base import World
def zooKeeperHouse(data):
    self = World(data, "zooKeeperHouse", "assets/maps/zooKeeperHouse.txt")

    self.add_entity(Entity(self, "door1Keeper", (14, 34), 'D',
                           [Event(data, self, "door1Keeper", "ON_INTERACT", "MOVE",
                                  target_scene="Zoo", target_position=(18, 55))]))
    self.add_entity(Entity(self, "door2Keeper", (14, 35), 'D',
                           [Event(data, self, "door2Keeper", "ON_INTERACT", "MOVE",
                                  target_scene="Zoo", target_position=(18, 56))]))

    self.add_entity(NPC(self, "zooKeeper", (8, 44), 'N', dialogue="assets/dialogues/test.json"))

    return self
Before we used classes for maps, that's why you see this "self" everywhere. You don't have to use it but if you wish to switch to a class later, you'll just have to change the def to class and add an __init__ method.
I'll put a more complete method in another text file for the creation of maps.
