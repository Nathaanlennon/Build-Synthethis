ITEMS FORMAT - how to create an item for `assets/items/items.json`

Structure
- The file is a JSON object where each property key is the item's unique `id` (snake_case).
- Each item value is an object describing that item.

Top-level item fields (common)
- `id` (required)
  - Type: string
  - Must match the parent key (unique identifier).
- `name` (required)
  - Type: string
  - Display name (can contain spaces and accents).
- `type` (required)
  - Type: string (enum)
  - Typical values: `equipment`, `consumable`, `junk`, `quest_item`.
- `description` (optional)
  - Type: string
  - Short text describing the item.
- `price` (optional)
  - Type: integer (>= 0)
  - Shop price or value.

Equipment-specific
- Applies when `type` == `equipment`.
- `position` (required)
  - Type: string
  - Equipment slot, e.g., "weapon", "headgear", "chestplate", "leggings", "boots", "shield".
- `damages` (optional, for weapons)
  - Type: integer (>= 0)
  - Attack power when equipped.

Consumable-specific
- Applies when `type` == `consumable`.
- `effect` (optional)
  - Type: object
  - Contains one effect key such as:
    - `heal`: integer (amount of HP restored).
    - `damage`: integer (instant damage to target).

Quest item / capacity items
- Applies when `type` == `quest_item`.
- `capacity` (optional)
  - Type: object mapping internal ability keys to ability definitions.
  - Each ability object typically has:
    - `name`: string (display name of the ability).
    - `damage`: integer (damage value).
    - `accuracy`: number (0.0 to 1.0).
not every quest item needs a capacity; some may just be keys for story progression.
Capacities in quest items is more like a special case for items that grant abilities.
In game logic it would be like if you want to give and retrieve abilities easily.
Like a magician getting spells books or something

Junk items
- `type` == `junk`
- Minimal fields commonly used: `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`.

Validation rules / conventions
- `id` must be unique and match the key string exactly.
- Use snake_case for `id` and internal keys.
- Numeric fields (`price`, `damages`, `damage`, `heal`) should be non-negative integers.
- `accuracy` is a float between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
- Keep JSON well-formed: use commas between properties, proper braces/brackets.

Examples (minimal)
- Equipment example:
  {
    "my_sword": {
      "id": "my_sword",
      "name": "My Sword",
      "type": "equipment",
      "position": "weapon",
      "damages": 12,
      "price": 40
    }
  }

- Consumable example:
  {
    "small_potion": {
      "id": "small_potion",
      "name": "Small Potion",
      "type": "consumable",
      "effect": { "heal": 25 },
      "price": 5
    }
  }

- Quest item example:
  {
    "fire_tome": {
      "id": "fire_tome",
      "name": "Fire Tome",
      "type": "quest_item",
      "capacity": {
        "fireball": { "name": "Fireball", "damage": 75, "accuracy": 0.8 }
      }
    }
  }

Notes
- Add only the fields needed for the item's behavior; unused fields may be ignored by the game but keep data consistent.
- When adding new fields or types, update game code that reads items accordingly.
